                            also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi
                            cinema. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan",[b] he has
                            appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare
                            Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Order
                            of Arts and Letters and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant
                            following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income,
                            several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the
                            world.[c] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora
                            communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

                            Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and
                            made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially
                            recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan
                            established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including
                            Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998),
                            Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara
                            (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an
                            alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama
                            Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with
                            Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came
                            with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion
                            to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback
                            and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan,
                            both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.

                            Srivastava;[1] 11 October 1942[7]) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi cinema. He is often
                            considered one of the greatest, most accomplished and commercially successful actors in the
                            history of Indian cinema.[8] With a cinematic career spanning over five decades, he has
                            played pivotal roles in over 200 films. Bachchan is often hailed as the Shahenshah of

                            of the Millennium, or simply Big B.[9] His dominance in the Indian film industry during the
                            1970s–80s led the French director François Truffaut to describe it as a "one-man
                            industry".[10] He is a recipient of several accolades including six National Film Awards and
                            sixteen Filmfare Awards.

                            Amitabh Bachchan was born in 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to the Hindi poet Harivansh
                            Rai Bachchan and his wife, the social activist Teji Bachchan. He was educated at Sherwood
                            College, Nainital, and Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi. His film career started in

                            greater stardom in later years, being dubbed India's "Angry Young Man" for several of his
                            on-screen roles in Hindi films.[11][12] He consistently starred in top–grossing Indian films

                            Raasta and Agneepath.[15][16] After taking a break from acting in the 1990s, his resurgence
                            was marked in 2000 with Mohabbatein.[17] Since then he starred in several successful and
                            acclaimed films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Aankhen, Baghban, Khakee, Black, Bunty Aur

                            Film Award for Best Actor, making him the only actor to do so. Bachchan also made an
                            appearance in a Hollywood film, The Great Gatsby (2013), in which he played a non-Indian
